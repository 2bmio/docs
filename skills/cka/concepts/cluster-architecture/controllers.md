  In robotics and automation, a control loop is a non-terminating loop that
  regulates the state of a system.

# Controllers

> Here is one example of a control loop: a thermostat in a room.
>
> When you set the temperature, thatâ€™s telling the thermostat about your _desired state_. The actual room temperature is the _current state_. The thermostat acts to bring the current state closer to the desired state, by turning equipment on or off.
>
> In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your [cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cluster) , then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state.
