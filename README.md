> Worst recruiters look for fullstack profiles or some other magic word like senior,  semi-senior, etc. The issue with recruiters is that get profits for quantities not for quality. A rasonable list of job titles include:

* * cloud architect

> In the major technology organizations the technicians are the most important asset!. They know that and create a way to keep this talent growing into the organization

[So, how big companies growing up the skills of their technicians?](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Apple,Amazon,Google,Facebook,Microsoft&track=Software%20Engineer#)

> Generally in any IT company Tech lead takes care of the technical aspects of the project or deliverable like helping juniors technically. A team lead is above tech lead and the tech lead reports to Team Lead & Manager . Its just a hierarchy.

> ## What is a Team Lead? What is a Tech Lead? Are they the same or different?

> These could feasibly be the same thing, or wildly different, depending on the organization.
>
> For me, Tech Lead is easier to define:
>
> * Senior technical team member.
> * ~30% of their time is still spent writing code.
> * The remaining ~70% is eliminating technical blockers, setting and evolving tech strategy, working with product owners and project managers to define and deliver the product vision as well as empowering, growing and onboarding their team members.
>
> I like to think of the role as a Software Developer who lightly manages the team, from within the team.
>
> A Team Lead \(in a big business, traditional sort of sense\) may differ in that they:
>
> * Aren't necessarily a technical team member \(or may be post-technical in the sense that they haven't written code in a good long while\).
> * Manage the team from the outside.
> * Concern themselves more with budgets and timelines than technical outcomes.
> * May be more involved in HR activities, like approving leave, reviewing salaries etc.
>
> Neither of these lists are exhaustive in terms of responsibility, and the venn diagram of what role has what responsibility will vary from business to business.
>
> What I will say is: Whether this is two roles, or one role serving both functions, all of the above is necessary for a team to perform well.
>
> My ultimate bugbear is "Tech Leads" who don't work within a team and don't write code, issuing orders from their weird, architect-y, tower. This can lead to a disconnect between tech strategy and implementation that will derail any team and/or product.
>
> My second ultimate bugbear is "Tech Leads" who refuse to consider business context when making technical decisions, and are only interested in writing code. This leads to building "cool" technologies that don't serve their stated purpose.
